# Back End Development Technical Challenge

## Word Doc

As part of Jumbos Programmer candidate process we would like you to complete a short development task.

The aim is to give you an opportunity to show us the way you solve problems and the development pattern you use.

There is no right or wrong way to approach this, there is only your way.

We would like you to create an API for a Pet store using a Microservices architecture style.

The API requirements have been set and can be found at https://petstore.swagger.io.

You should allow yourself 4 hours to complete your work; it is not expected that you will provide a full solution.

We will be looking at:

* One endpoint fully operational
* Your approach to Microservices architecture
* Models used
* Code style
* How testable your solution is

Once finished please publish your results to an online repository hosting service (GitHub for example) and please submit your technical challenge via https://jumbointeractive.typeform.com/to/TtVa2R
